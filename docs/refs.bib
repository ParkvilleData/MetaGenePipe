               is more severe in immunodeficient animals, suggesting an

               agent as an atypical virus, termed ``mouse kidney parvovirus''

               controlled by the adaptive immune system. Detailed analysis of
               the clinical course and histopathological features demonstrated
               a stepwise progression of pathology ranging from sporadic
               tubular inclusions to tubular degeneration and interstitial

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate
               very large numbers of short reads. Even with very deep genome
               coverage, short read lengths cause problems in de novo
               assemblies. The use of paired-end libraries with a fragment size
               shorter than twice the read length provides an opportunity to
               generate much longer reads by overlapping and merging read pairs
               before assembling a genome. RESULTS: We present FLASH, a fast
               computational tool to extend the length of short reads by
               overlapping paired-end reads from fragment libraries that are
               sufficiently short. We tested the correctness of the tool on one
               million simulated read pairs, and we then applied it as a
               pre-processor for genome assemblies of Illumina reads from the
               bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and human chromosome 14. FLASH
               correctly extended and merged reads >99\% of the time on
               simulated reads with an error rate of <1\%. With adequately set
               parameters, FLASH correctly merged reads over 90\% of the time
               even when the reads contained up to 5\% errors. When FLASH was
               used to extend reads prior to assembly, the resulting assemblies

  author    = "Schmieder, Robert and Edwards, Robert",
  abstract  = "High-throughput sequencing technologies have strongly impacted
               microbiology, providing a rapid and cost-effective way of
               generating draft genomes and exploring microbial diversity.
               However, sequences obtained from impure nucleic acid
               preparations may contain DNA from sources other than the sample.
               Those sequence contaminations are a serious concern to the
               quality of the data used for downstream analysis, causing
               misassembly of sequence contigs and erroneous conclusions.
               Therefore, the removal of sequence contaminants is a necessary
               and required step for all sequencing projects. We developed
               DeconSeq, a robust framework for the rapid, automated
               identification and removal of sequence contamination in
               longer-read datasets (150 bp mean read length). DeconSeq is
               publicly available as standalone and web-based versions. The
               results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the
               databases used for the web-based version are automatically
               updated on a regular basis. DeconSeq categorizes possible
               contamination sequences, eliminates redundant hits with higher
               similarity to non-contaminant genomes, and provides graphical
               visualizations of the alignment results and classifications.
               Using DeconSeq, we conducted an analysis of possible human DNA
               contamination in 202 previously published microbial and viral
               metagenomes and found possible contamination in 145 (72\%)
               metagenomes with as high as 64\% contaminating sequences. This
               new framework allows scientists to automatically detect and
               efficiently remove unwanted sequence contamination from their
               datasets while eliminating critical limitations of current
               methods. DeconSeq's web interface is simple and user-friendly.
               The standalone version allows offline analysis and integration
               into existing data processing pipelines. DeconSeq's results
               reveal whether the sequencing experiment has succeeded, whether
               the correct sample was sequenced, and whether the sample
               contains any sequence contamination from DNA preparation or
               host. In addition, the analysis of 202 metagenomes demonstrated
               significant contamination of the non-human associated
               metagenomes, suggesting that this method is appropriate for
               screening all metagenomes. DeconSeq is available at

               a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most
               of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or

               heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low
               sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms
               already produce longer reads and others are expected to become

               rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line
               applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for
               processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run

               only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and

               point out some of these conditions, one of the concepts proposed
               by Edgar Morin to describe the functioning of ``complex''
               systems: the dialogical principle has been used. The idea is to
               look for some dialogical pairs. The elements of this kind of
               pair are both complementary and antagonist to one another. Three
               dialogical pairs are presented in this communication. The first
               two pairs are related to the organization of the HOF network and
               the last one is related to the methods which are used to analyse
               the working situations. The three pairs are: specialist -
               non-specialist actors of the network, centralized - distributed
               human resources in the network and microscopic - macroscopic
               levels of HOF methods to analyse the working situations. To
               continuously improve these three dialogical pairs, it is
               important to keep the differences which exist between the two
               elements of a pair and to find and maintain a balance between
               the two elements of the pairs.",

               personnel on site, and then to get new recruits and experienced
               technicians from other sites as the policy for leaving personnel

               most experienced do not accept the way newcomers are induced on
               site, whereas the management accuses them of resisting change.
               The intervention consisted in reconnecting local and corporate

               two sets of data that they held separately. Different types of

Next, in GeneMark-ET we proposed a method of integration of unsupervised training with information on intron positions revealed by mapping short RNA reads. Now we describe GeneMark-EP, a tool that utilizes another source of external information, a protein database, readily available prior to the start of a sequencing project. A new specialized pipeline, ProtHint, initiates massive protein mapping to genome and extracts hints to splice sites and translation start and stop sites of potential genes. GeneMark-EP uses the hints to improve estimation of model parameters as well as to adjust coordinates of predicted genes if they disagree with the most reliable hints (the -EP+ mode). Tests of GeneMark-EP and -EP+ demonstrated improvements in gene prediction accuracy in comparison with GeneMark-ES, while the GeneMark-EP+ showed higher accuracy than GeneMark-ET. We have observed that the most pronounced improvements in gene prediction accuracy happened in large eukaryotic genomes.}",

Starting from genomic DNA sequences representing a complete genome, EuGene is able to predict the major transcript units in the genome from a variety of sources of information: statistical information, similarities with known transcripts and proteins, but also any GFF3 structured information supporting the presence or absence of specific types of elements. EuGene has been used to find genes in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Theobroma cacao; tomato, sunflower, and Rosa genomes; and in the nematode Meloidogyne incognita genome, among many others. The large fraction of plant in this list probably influenced EuGene development, especially in its capacities to withstand a genome with a large number of repeated regions and transposable elements.",

However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.Results: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.Availability: The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba\_udContact:chin@cs.hku.hk}",
