# Summary

Microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi are ubiquitous in our environment. The study of microorganisms and their full genomes has been enabled through advances in culture independent techniques and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Whole genome metagenomics shotgun sequencing (WGS) empowers researchers to study biological functions of microorganisms, and how their presence affect human disease or a specific ecosystem. However, advanced and novel bioinformatics techniques are required to process the data into a suitable format. There is no standardised bioinformatics framework a microbiologist can use effectively.
